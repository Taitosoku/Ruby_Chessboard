# Song lyrics

Fat girl, fat jokes.

Fat girl, skinny friends.

Fat girl stand next to fatter people to look thin.

Fat girl, fat camp, five years.

Fat girl lost 2 pounds and you didn’t notice.

Fat girl love your garlic bread.

Fat girl, vegan.

Fat girl, but red velvet cupcake taste so delicious.

Fat girl, pretty face.

Fat girl, Dean’s list.

Fat girl want fries with that.

Fat girl, don’t touch her stomach.

Fat girl, turn the lights off.

Fat girl, keep her t-shirt on.

Fat girl not pregnant.

Fat girl, food baby.

Fat girl named her dog taco.

Fat girl, bad bulimic.

Fat girl, binge and no purge.

Fat girl can’t even throw up right.

Fat girl unbutton her pants at dinner.

Fat girl heard, “nothing tastes as good a thin feels.”

Fat girl certain soul food taste better than being thin feels.

Fat girl threw out her scale.

Fat girl, you are what you eat.

Fat girl, double stuffed Oreos.

Fat girl got her father’s genes.

Fat girl’s brother didn’t.

Fat girl’s friends come over to stare her brother’s chiseled abdominals

Fat girl don’t hate her body.

Fat girl hate the world.

Fat girl, fat mouth.

Fat girl, fatter fist.

Fat girl, fuck you.

Fat girl, heart so fat it needs it own zip code.

Fat girl, heart so fat, it uses the equator as its belt.

Fat girl, seafood diet: fat girl see food, fat girl eat it.

Fat girl heard all the jokes.

Fat girl finish the punch line before you do.

Fat girl cry in private.

Fat girl, thick skin.

Fat girl, dance anyway.

Fat girl, shirt off.

Fat girl, lights on.

Fat girl, lights on.
